# Data Mining Techniques to Predict NBA Playersâ€™ Salary Category 
This project aims to find out the optimal data mining technique amongst (linear regression, logistics regression, neural network, decision tree and naive Bayes) to predict the salary category (HIGH/LOW) of an NBA player.The independent variables used to predict this are in-game performance metrics, for example a playerâ€™s average points scored per game or average minutes played per game.

## Use Case
NBA teams have limited resources and they need to prioritize negotiating with players who they have a chance at signing. The NBA is extremely competitive, and any time spent on negotiating with a player who isnâ€™t likely to sign with them would be much better spent negotiating with a player who is more likely to earn less than or equal to a certain predefined salary value.

This system helps the management priotitize the players to negotiate and sign them sooner.
## Getting Started ðŸ’»

### Clone the Repository 

Get started by cloning the project to your local machine:

```
$ https://github.com/Samiksha25/NBA-Salary-Categorization-System.git
```

## Installation
1.R installation:
Navigate to https://cran.r-project.org/

2.RStudio Installation:

Navigate to https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download

## Usage
For every .r file update the working directory of the dataset to the location to the location where it is stored in your local system.
Run the R code in RStudio and observe the outcomes.

## Findings
My findings are that the k-nearest neighbor model has the highest accuracy of all the models (84%). However, the logistic model performed almost as well (84% accurate) and can tell us more information about which independent variables have a significant impact on a player falling into a high or low salary category.
