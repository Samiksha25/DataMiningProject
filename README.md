# Data Mining Techniques to Predict NBA Players’ Salary Category 
This project aims to find out the optimal data mining technique amongst (linear regression, logistics regression, neural network, decision tree and naive Bayes) to predict the salary category (HIGH/LOW) of an NBA player.

## Use Case
NBA teams do not have unlimited resources and they need to prioritize negotiating with players who they have a chance at signing. The NBA is extremely competitive, and any time spent on negotiating with a player who isn’t likely to sign with them would be much better spent negotiating with a player who is more likely to earn less than or equal to a certain predefined salary value.

This system helps the management priotitize the players to negotiate and sign them sooner.
